                    <h3>My Childhood</h3>
                    <p>Hi, My name is Chirstopher Joel Rom. I am 23 years of age and I live in my house. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a respectable businessman in our community. My mother is a doctor. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose. We are three brothers and sisters. Being the eldest I am the most liable from my brothers and sisters. I am wanted to guide and take care of my other siblings. We all are in the same school. Reading is my passion.</p>

                    <h3>My Teenage life</h3>
                    <p>In any society, there are different stages of life. There is childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Each stage has its own unique challenges and rewards. Adolescence, or teenage years, is a time of great change for individuals. It can be both exciting and challenging as young people learn to navigate the new terrain of their lives.

                    <h3>My Adulthood</h3>
                    <p>Becoming an Adult That old saying “enjoy being a kid while you can” or when people told you that when you’re an adult that you will miss being a kid. Everything they told you as a kid was true. As a kid you have no responsibilities, no bills, and no worries. The moment you turn 18 you get slapped with adulthood, and it’s a rude awakening. This is a stage in life that I was not prepared for and wish it could have been avoided. Take me back to being 8 and my toys being the only things I have to worry about. As an adult I always wanted to be successful. Being successful to me has never been being rich and all of that, for me it’s more of not struggling, having family, and most of all being happy. It all starts when you turn 16 and you are able to get a job. As a kid I was always eager to be an adult, get a job, have my own car, etc. Oh boy do I regret all of that. Once you get that job and start making your own money, the responsibilities come in. Finding out that there is such a thing called car insurance was a terrible day for me. Growing up I was oblivious to all the things that come along with being an adult. I thought you were able do …show more content…
                        Once I turned 18 it’s time to live on my own. That is usually the cultural norm, time to really become an adult and have my own place. In my mind it’s all great and I felt grown up. I started having to pay rent, utilities, cable/internet and all my groceries. That means I have to work more with no time left in me. </p>
